# Minecraft TODO

A single page Rails application for organizing Minecraft ToDo list.

Todo lists are listed on the index page and created from an AJax form and updated asynchronosly after updating.

Originally, this application was to include list of all MineCraft item blocks, but that functionality was rolled into its own gem called [Minecraft Items](https://github.com/malexander15/minecraft_items)
